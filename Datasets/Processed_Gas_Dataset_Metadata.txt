#Description of Variables
Time:                     Time of measurement from start of incubation in hours.
CO2_Produced:             Moles of CO2 produced in 2 hours of incubation since last measurement (Mass Balanced).
CO2_Error:                Uncertainty on the calculated value in Moles of CO2.
O2_Consumed:              Moles of O2 consumed in 2 hours of incubation since the last measurement (Mass Balanced).
O2_Error:                 Uncertainty on the calculated value in Moles of O2.
RQ:                       Respiratory Quotient for each 2 hour incubation window (Mass Balanced). Calculated as (CO2_Produced / O2_Consumed)
RQ_Error:                 Uncertainty propogated through calculation of RQ.
Bottle:                   Sample Bottle Identifier; Incubation 1: (1:Bottle 1, 2: Bottle 2, 3: Bottle 3, 4:Bottle 4, 5: Bottle 5, 7:Bottle 7, 8: Bottle 8), Incubation 2: (9: Bottle 1, 10: Bottle 2, 11: Bottle 3, 12:                              Bottle 4, 13: Bottle 5, 15: Bottle 7, 16: Bottle 8)
CUE_est:                  Estimate of Carbon Use Efficiency, derived from RQ-CUE relationship. Calculated with Predict.lm() in R.
Biomass_growth_est:       Calculated micromoles of C used in production of biomass. Calculated using Respiration Rate, and CUE_est.
Cumulative_Biomass_est:   Cumulative sum of Biomass production in millimoles carbon. 
CO2:                      CO2 respiration per 2 hours in micromoles carbon.
O2:                       O2 consumption per 2 hours in micromoles carbon. 
Treatment:                Soil treatment. (Control, 100, 200, 500, 1000)

#Description of Data
Mass Balanced respiration rates, and derived variables used in the production of plots. This data is the totality of two dataset joined together from the first incubation and the second incubation. 

#Data Usage
This dataset is partly imported from excel as mass balanced data, and partly derived and calculated in R. Dataset was saved from R. Data from this file was used to produce Figues 3 and 4.
