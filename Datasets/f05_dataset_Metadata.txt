#Description of Variables
Treatment:         Soil treatments (100, 200, 500, 1000) in mg glucose.
Replication:       Number of treatment replicates used in calculation of mean values.
Amendment:         Average mass of carbon amended to the soil in mg per bottle (+/- uncertainty).
Respired:          Average cumulative sum of carbon dioxide respired in mg carbon per bottle (+/- uncertainty) from measured gas observations from "Processed_Gas_Dataset.csv".
Salt Extractable:  Average measured increase in unfumigated K2SO4 extractable carbon (Final Incubated - Time 0) in mg per bottle (+/- uncertainty).
Biomass:           Average measured increase in biomass carbon using Chloroform-Fumigation Extraction method (Final Incubated - Time 0) in mg carbon per bottle (+/- uncertainty). 
Necromass:         Average accumulated necromass in mg carbon per bottle (+/- uncertainty), calculated as (RQ derived biomass growth - CFE measured biomass increase).

#Data Usage
This data was compiled from incubation gas data and from laboratory procedure data. Data was used to produce f05.svg in "Main/Figures" and is presented as table 1.
