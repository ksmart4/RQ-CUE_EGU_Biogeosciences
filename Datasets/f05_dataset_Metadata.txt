#Description of Variables
RQ_Biomass:    Cumulative sum of predicted biomass produced in millimoles carbon using the RQ-CUE relationship and measured gas observations from "Processed_Gas_Dataset.csv".
CFE_Biomass:   Measured increase in biomass carbon using Chloroform-Fumigation Extraction method in millimoles carbon. 
Treatment:     Soil treatments (100, 200, 500, 1000) in mg glucose.
Bottle:        Individual Sample Identifier; Incubation 1: (3: Bottle 3, 4: Bottle 4, 5: Bottle 5, 7: Bottle 7, 8: Bottle 8), Incubation 2: (11: Bottle 3, 12: Bottle 4, 13: Bottle 5, 15: Bottle 7, 16: Bottle 8)

#Data Usage
This data was compiled from incubation gas data and from laboratory procedure data. Data was used to produce f05.svg in "Main/Figures".
