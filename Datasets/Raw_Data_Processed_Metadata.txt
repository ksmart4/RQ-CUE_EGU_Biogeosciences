#Brief Project Description
Soils collected from Jennings Woods Research Forest, property of Kent State University (Location Collected: Lat: 41.1789908 Lon: -81.2031001). 
Soil Collected: Oi-horizon + Top 5 cm of A-horizon.
Experiment Location: Kent State University, Department of Earth Sciences.
Experiment Type: Laboratory Soil Incubation.
Soil Pre-treatment: Returned to lab, opened to air, allowed to dry for 2 weeks. 
Soil Incubation Treatment: Control soils were wet with 10 ml of DI Type 1 (MilliQ) water, capped, and flushed with CO2-Free Air for three minutes. This was followed by the initiation of the sampling cycles. Treatment Samples were carried out similarly, but amendment was added to soil prior to addition of water. 

#Description of Variables
FMS_Temp:            Internal Temperature of the FoxBox Analyzer in Degrees C
CYCLE:               Measurement Cycle Count (starts at 0).
Bottle:              Sample Identifier in order of Measurement Cycle. (1: CO2-Free Air, 2: Bottle 1, 3: Bottle 2, 4: Bottle 3, 5: Bottle 4, 6: Bottle 5, 7: Bottle 6, 8: Bottle 7, 9: Bottle 8, 10: 5000 ppm CO2).
DateTime:            YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format timestamps for each measurement taken. 
CO2_Samp:            Average CO2 concentration in % of sample.
CO2_Samp_stdv:       Standard deviation of CO2 concentration in % of sample.
O2_Samp:             Average O2 concentration in % of sample.
O2_Samp_stdv:        Standard deviation of O2 concentration in % of sample.
FlowRate_Samp:       Average flow rate of FoxBox analyzer during sample measurement in ml/min.
FlowRate_Samp_stdv:  Standard deviation of flow rate of FoxBox analyzer during sample measurement in ml/min.
CO2_BG:              Average CO2 concentration in % of background measurement before sample. 
CO2_BG_stdv:         Standard deviation of CO2 concentration in % of background before sample.
O2_BG:               Average O2 concentration in % of background measurement before sample.
O2_BG_stdv:          Standard deviation of O2 concentration in % of background before sample.
FlowRate_BG:         Average flow rate of FoxBox analyzer during background measurement in ml/min.
FlowRate_BG_stdv:    Standard deviation of flow rate of FoxBox analyzer during background measurement in ml/min.

#Description of Data
Measurement of sample (soil headspace gas), and background (HVAC supply air). This data was extracted and analyzed from raw data file output from Programmable Logic Controller. Datastream from FoxBox was streamed in through serial port and stored as string. String values were appended to Solenoid Logs and saved into a single raw data file. O2_Samp and O2_Samp_stdv have been corrected linearly to adjust background measurement to 20.95%. All Variables with "BG" in the name are here for checking data quality, and for correction.

#Data Usage
This data was then imported to excel for mass balance calculations to be carried out.
