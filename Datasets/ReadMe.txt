#Brief Project Description
Soils collected from Jennings Woods Research Forest, property of Kent State University (Location Collected: Lat: 41.1789908 Lon: -81.2031001). 
Soil Collected: Oi-horizon + Top 5 cm of A-horizon.
Experiment Location: Kent State University, Department of Earth Sciences.
Experiment Type: Laboratory Soil Incubation.
Soil Pre-treatment: Returned to lab, opened to air, allowed to dry for 2 weeks. 
Soil Incubation Treatment: Control soils were wet with 10 ml of DI Type 1 (MilliQ) water, capped, and flushed with CO2-Free Air for three minutes. This was followed by the initiation of the sampling cycles. Treatment Samples were carried out similarly, but amendment was added to soil prior to addition of water.

#File Descriptions
Data which was used to produce figure 1 plot, which was derived stoichiometrically in excel and imported to R and fit with 8th order polynomial for use as RQ-CUE relationship can be found in "modelleddata.csv".
Data which was processed from Raw Files generated from PLC and FoxBox data on incubation can be found in "Raw_Data_Processed.csv".
